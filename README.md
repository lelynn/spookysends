# spookysends
A Python tool for overlaying "ghost" climbers onto a climbing video, using segmentation/alpha masks and background subtraction &amp; frame alignment. Pause moments in your climbing send are replaced by failed attempts, creating a spooky visualization of past and present climbs. Built with OpenCV, NumPy, and some climbing footage!
